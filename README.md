# Basics Java Concepts

### To run java we need two things:
    1. JDK [ Java Development Kit ]
       - Our java program is compiled and run through JDK. 
       - JDK download [ Above 8th version ]
    2. IDE or Editor ~ Eclipse
       - Integrated Development Environment
       - Benefit is that it has compiler along with the editer, so we can compile java program and run it as well.
       - Select Eclipse IDE for Java Developer Configuration

Note: Eclipse is an IDE, We tell it the path of JDK and it compiles and runs our code by using that JDK by going that path.
